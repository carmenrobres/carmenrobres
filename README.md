Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm an Industrial Designer Engineer exploring the exciting world of AI in my Master's program for Design for Emerging Futures. ðŸš€

Iâ€™m diving deep into creative design, technology, and understanding their impact on society. Right now, I'm expanding my skills in computational design, AI, and digital fabrication while learning to code along the way.

Join me on this journey as I experiment, learn, and share projects that mix design, technology, and a dash of curiosity!

Letâ€™s connect and create the future together! âœ¨
